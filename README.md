# Room Data Collector based on HelTec ESP32-LoRa

The project consists of an ESP32 microcontroller platform manufactured by HelTec Automation
and includes a LoRa-tranceiver module.

## Motivation and Goals

During my Masterthesis I found first evaluations of LoRa in the sector of home- and building-automation.
Therefore, my Motivation is build on top of the fact, that even, if LoRa is not designed especifically for 
building-automation, it would be fun to have an LoRa-based smart-home system.
